            Something new we are trying out this year is to have members host a brew day at their house on (perhaps) a monthly basis.  The club will provide some food, so everyone can come out and share some beers see how different people brew and just try and have some general fun!
        </p>
        <p>
            This is also a chance to bring people that aren't necessarily members but are interested in homebrewing, our club, or just people who like good food and beer!
        </p>

            William is hosting the first one. More details will be added as they are hammered out.
